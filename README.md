## Typical Arrays Problems
*Task*
There are a few typical problems while you working with arrays, and your goal is to solve it.

**You should implement 3 functions: max, min, and avg for searching minimal value, maximal value, and an average value of a given array.**

For example:

min(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 1;
max(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 4;
avg(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 2.5;
Please note, that you should return 0 if no params specified or an empty array passed

All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.

*My solution - 63 passing*
